            <h3>Special Relativity with Geometric Algebra - Electromagnetism</h3>
            <div>
                Electromagnetism is most often described using Maxwell's equations in vector form.
                In Geometric Algebra these can be expressed as a single equation and a field that unifies the electric and magnetic fields.
                This also makes it very easy to combine our results from Special Relativity with Electromagnetism.
            </div>
            <div>
                There are already a lot of resources showing how to do Electromagnetism with GA. Here are a couple of short ones that get the essence if you are interested:

                </ul>

                For now we actually won't use any of Maxwell's equations. The relevant part to us is that the electric and magnetic fields will be bivector fields $E$ and $B$ using the bivectors that
                square to $+1$ ({`$e_{tx}, e_{ty}, e_{tz}$`} corresponding to each direction in space) and that they can be combined into a single bivector field $F$ called the Faraday field in the following way:
            </div>
            <div style={{ padding: 20 }}>
                {`
                \\begin{equation}
                F = E + I B
                \\end{equation}
                `}
            </div>
            <div>
                Because the magnetic bivector field is multiplied by the pseudoscalar $I$, in general $F$ contains all bivectors in the algebra.
            </div>
            <div>
                In the next part we will investigate an electric field as seen
                by an observer moving orthogonal to it.
            </div>
            <h4>Electric field seen by observer moving orthogonal to it</h4>
            <ImageWithSub src="/images/sr-efield-movingobs.png" text="Figure 1 - Blue: Rest frame. Purple: Moving observer's frame. Red: Electric field in x direction of rest frame. Pink: Rotor from rest frame to moving observer's frame." width="60%" />
            <div>
                Let's start with an <u style={{textDecorationColor: "red", textDecorationThickness: 3}}>electric field $E$</u> with only a value $E_x$ in the $x$ direction
            </div>
            <div style={{ padding: 20 }}>
                {`
                \\begin{equation}
                F = E = E_x e_{tx}
                \\end{equation}
                `}
            </div>
            <div>
                An observer moving relative to it with rapidity $\varphi_y$ in the $y$ direction can be described using a rotor
            </div>
            <div style={{ padding: 20 }}>
                {`
                \\begin{equation}
                R(\\varphi_y) = e^{-\\frac{\\varphi_y}{2} e_{ty}}
                \\end{equation}
                `}
            </div>
            <div>
                The <u style={{textDecorationColor: "pink", textDecorationThickness: 3}}>rotor $R$</u> transforms from the <u style={{textDecorationColor: "blue", textDecorationThickness: 3}}>rest frame</u> to
                the <u style={{textDecorationColor: "purple", textDecorationThickness: 3}}>moving observer's frame</u>.
                From the observer's view, the field is moving in the opposite direction, so
                to get how they see the field we need to apply the reverse rotor to the field.
            </div>
            <div style={{ padding: 20 }}>
                {`
                \\begin{equation}
                    \\widetilde{R} F R = E_x e^{\\frac{\\varphi_y}{2} e_{ty}} e_{tx} e^{-\\frac{\\varphi_y}{2} e_{ty}}
                    \\label{eq:transformfaraday}
                \\end{equation}
                `}
            </div>
            <div>
                Before continuing with the algebra, let's take another look at the diagram. What would we expect to happen if we applied the rotor to the field?
                The field has a bivector lies in the TX plane, so its component is parallel to the T axis. The rotor (hyperbolically) rotates between the T and the Y axis.
                So we would expect that the resulting bivector field would also get a TY component.
            </div>
            <div>
                Okay now for the algebra: we could expand both exponentials in {`\\eqref{eq:transformfaraday}`} into $cosh$ and $sinh$ and simplify. This is a decent amount of effort.
                Alternatively, we notice that the rotor consists of a scalar and {`$e_{ty}$`} part. The scalar part commutes with {`$e_{tx}$`} and the bivector
                part anti-commutes with it (picks up a minus sign). When expanding the exponential, the scalar part can also be written with negated argument to $cosh$ because $cosh(x) = cosh(-x)$.
                So commuting and applying this idea will result in:
            </div>
            <div style={{ padding: 20 }}>
                {`
                \\begin{equation}
                \\begin{aligned}
                e_{tx} R & = e_{tx} (cosh(-\\frac{\\varphi_y}{2}) + sinh(-\\frac{\\varphi_y}{2}) e_{ty}) = \\\\
                & = (cosh(-\\frac{\\varphi_y}{2}) + sinh(\\frac{\\varphi_y}{2}) e_{ty}) e_{tx} = \\\\
                & = (cosh(\\frac{\\varphi_y}{2}) + sinh(\\frac{\\varphi_y}{2}) e_{ty}) e_{tx} = \\widetilde{R} e_{tx}
                \\end{aligned}
                \\end{equation}
                `}
            </div>
            <div>
                So {`\\eqref{eq:transformfaraday}`} simplifies to
            </div>
            <div style={{ padding: 20 }}>
                {`
                \\begin{equation}
                    \\begin{aligned}
                        \\widetilde{R} F R & = E_x \\widetilde{R}^2 e_{tx} = E_x (cosh(\\varphi_y) + sinh(\\varphi_y) e_{ty}) e_{tx}) = \\\\
                        & = E_x (cosh(\\varphi_y) e_{tx} + sinh(\\varphi_y) e_{xy})
                    \\end{aligned}
                    \\label{eq:transform-faraday}
                \\end{equation}
                `}
            </div>
            <div>
                The result has an {`$e_{tx}$`} part, which is just the original electric field's direction. The faster the observer moves the stronger it gets.
                But it also has an {`$e_{xy}$`} part. If we look back to how $F$ was defined we can see that this part comes from $I B$,
                specifically the Z component of the magnetic field because {`$e_{xy} = I e_{tz}$`}. So a moving observer will also see a magnetic field
                perpendicular to both their movement direction and the electric field's direction.
            </div>
            <div style={{ padding: 20 }}>
                {`
                \\begin{equation}

                        B_z' & = E_x sinh(\\varphi_y)
